Abstraction:
emphasize what's important & de-emphasize the unimportant
at a particular level of detail
Flexibility:
apply components in various ways that weren't originally anticipated.
resuability:
take components developed before & apply them in new contexts,
where they may not have been intended initially
Modularity:
divide & conquer a big problem space into smaller chunks
that have low coupling & high conhesion
Allow developers & teams can work independently
